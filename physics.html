        Intermolecular forces:- The forces of attraction and repulsion between their molecules . These forces ,are called intermolecular .
Their is to forces <strong>1) cohesive force.  2) adhesive force</strong>
Cohesive force:- the force of attraction between 2 molecules of same substance called as cohesion <p>
Adhesive force:- the force of attraction and repulsion between the two different substance like liquid and solid ,solid with gas etc. is called adhesion.
Range of molecular forces:- The maximum distance between 2 molecules upto which intermolecular forces are effective (also called as short range forces). Distance (10 to the power -9).
Sphere of influence :- an imaginary sphere drawn with given molecule as centre and radius equal to the molecular range . <p>
Surface film :- The layer of surface of liquid whose thickness is about equal to range of molecular attraction.
Surface energy :- when a molecular is taken from the inside to the surface layer work is done against the inward resultant force .the work is stored in the formed of potential energy is a surface energy of the liquid.
The potential energy per unit area of the liquid surface under isothermal condition is called surface energy per unit area.
Potential energy is the greater for molecule at the surface film as compared to a molecules well inside the liquid. <p>
These surface energy :- s.I unit - joules.           CGS unit- erg.    Dimensions- [L2  M1.  T(-2)]. <p>
Surface tension :- the force per unit length acting on right angle to the imaginary line drawn on the free surface of on liquid is called as surface tension .
T= F/ L.        T=SURFACE TENSION                      F =FORCE   , L= LENGTH                                     UNIT-  N/A

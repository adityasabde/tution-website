            DNA has bases like adenine , gunine , cytosine , thymine.                                                 
RNA has bases like adenine, gunine , cytosine , urasil.  <p>                                                     
Adenine have hydrogen bond with thymine and cytosine have hydrogen bond with gunine.                                                                      
D- fructose , D - manose ,D- glucose , form a same osazone product . <p>                                         
Osazone product is form when the glucose etc . Are reacts with phenyl hydrazine .    <p>        
Osazone reduce with Zn and acetic acid  then it forms the ketone as a product.  <p>            
When glucose undergoes osazone process then it will be  converted into fructose. <p> Then Futher hydrolysis gives the osone as a product .these process use to conver the aldoes sugar ( glucose) to ketones sugar ( fructose ).                                                                 
When glucose reacts with alkali with hydrolysis gives the gives the cis enol and trans enol both. While cis enol is tautomerise to give fructose . And trans enol is tautomerise to give D- manose.                   
Despite having aldehyde on glucose does not give 2-4 DNP test or Schiff base test . <p>        
Glucose pentacetate does not reacts with hydroxyl amine .                                                    
Fructose is known as the fruit sugar.                <p>
Maltose is an reducing sugar.                              
If a is a naturally occurring amino acid the the maximum number of tripeptides are cube of a or( a cube).   <p>                           
Proteins when treated with conc.HNO3 give yellow colour this is called as xanthaoprotic test .             <p>                                                                 
D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose present in nucleic acid.
